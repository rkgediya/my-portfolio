## Overview

Development of AI-driven voice and email automation systems using Salesforce, Node.js, and Twilio to streamline customer support workflows and business data operations.

## Key Features

- **AI Voice Calling System**: Created a real-time, AI-powered voice calling system using Twilio, Deepgram, and WebSockets. Integrated ChatGPT to generate intelligent live responses, improving CSR team productivity and reducing manual workload.
- **AI-Powered Outlook Email System Clone**: Recreated a fully customizable Outlook-style email platform in Salesforce using LWC with several advanced features:
  - **Auto Reply Generation**: Used OpenAI to generate contextual, intelligent replies to incoming emails based on case history and email content.
  - **Lead & Opportunity Extraction**: Automatically parsed incoming email content using AI and rule-based logic to capture and populate potential leads or opportunities in Salesforce.
  - **Email Attachment Handling**: Enabled users to view and attach email files (PDFs, images, docs) directly to any Salesforce record with a single button click.
  - **Search and Filter Capabilities**: Implemented advanced filters (by sender, subject, date, etc.) to enhance CSR usability and speed.
  - **Categorization and Color Coding**: Custom rules to highlight and categorize emails (e.g., new lead, follow-up, support case) with color-coded labels.
  - **Inline Email Viewer**: Developed a smooth, in-app reading experience with rich-text and file preview support.
  - **Bulk Actions and Tracking**: Support for selecting multiple emails to log or attach, and track their association with related records.
- **Customer Portal & API Layer**: Developed a React-based customer portal with dynamic data rendered from Apex REST APIs. Built a Node.js middleware to securely connect the portal with Salesforce and handle data requests/responses.
- **Salesforce Automation**: Built custom Flows, Process Builders, and LWC components to manage leads, opportunities, property data, and inspections. Enhanced UX with dynamic editors and automated business rules.
- **Microsoft Calendar Integration**: Connected Salesforce with Microsoft Calendar for automatic scheduling of property inspections. Enabled real-time creation, updates, and deletions of events based on Salesforce triggers.
- **Aircall Integration**: Integrated Aircall with Salesforce to capture incoming call logs, call summaries, agent assignments, and team data using Webhooks and REST APIs.
- **Xero Integration**: Automated invoicing and receipt management by integrating Xero APIs with Salesforce. Built scheduled batch processes for syncing financial data and ensuring accurate reconciliation.
- **HubSpot Integration**: Created real-time contact sync between Salesforce and HubSpot using custom webhooks and APIs. Ensured Salesforce remained the single source of truth for contact records.
- **CoreLogic Integration**: Used CoreLogic API to fetch property data based on customer details. Designed custom LWC components for visualizing property insights and linking them to leads and opportunities.
- **OpenAI & NLP Utilities**: Built LWC interfaces and background services that use OpenAI (ChatGPT), Eleven Labs, and AssemblyAI for automating small CSR tasks such as summarizing interactions, generating content, and transcribing data.
