## Overview

Led the architecture and implementation of an end-to-end Salesforce CRM system for Rocketship Financial to streamline lead tracking, task management, and communication processes. Delivered part-time over a 9-month period, this project focused on customizing Salesforce to support operational growth and data integrity.

## Key Features

- **Custom LWC Pages for Lead & Account**: Built Lightning Web Component-based record pages for Lead and Account objects, delivering enhanced UI and dynamic functionality for end users.
- **Lead Activity Audit Trail**: Developed a transparent tracking system using Apex and LWC to log and display all updates, merges, and conversions performed on lead records.
- **Advanced Duplicate Record Merging**: Created a robust duplicate detection and merging tool using LWC and batch processing. Included a visual UI to manage duplicate groups with field-level history tracking.
- **Duplicate Prevention Mechanisms**: Used custom logic and Salesforce duplicate rules to detect and prevent creation of redundant lead or account records.
- **REST API Integrations**: Integrated third-party platforms to enable automated lead upserts into Salesforce, ensuring accurate and real-time data sync.
- **Lead Management Enhancements**:
  - **PIN Search UI**: Built custom UI for searching and locating leads by unique PINs and metadata.
  - **Round Robin Distribution**: Developed logic for balanced assignment of leads across users.
  - **Custom Lead Conversion Process**: Replaced standard conversion flow with a tailored Apex-based version for greater control and flexibility.
  - **List View Assignment Management**: Programmatic control of lead list views for efficient task segregation.
- **Task Calendar with Visualforce + DayPilot**: Designed a calendar interface using the DayPilot JS library within a Visualforce page. Enabled hierarchical permissions and collision prevention for task scheduling.
- **Dialpad Integration**: Configured AppExchange Dialpad package with Salesforce Call Center and Open CTI. Added Dialpad to Utility Bar for native call handling from within the Salesforce UI.
- **Third-party API Integrations**:
  - **EvvoFinancial and BeyondFinance**: Bi-directional data sync for lead intake and disposition updates using RESTful API integrations.
- **UI & Metadata Customization**: Built and configured utility bars, global actions, record types, layouts, and field validation rules to match business processes and user flows.
